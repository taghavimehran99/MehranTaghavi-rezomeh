    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h4>
      Born on January 10, 1999, I graduated from Sohrudi University with a GPA of 17.75 in 2019. In
      addition to my studies, I gained a variety of work experiences during and after my university
      years that helped me develop my skills and practical perspective in related fields.After
      completing my studies, I completed my 18-month military service and entered the job market
      with a focus on learning and progress. This path gave me the opportunity to combine my
      theoretical knowledge and practical experience and take steps towards achieving my career
      goals.
